# Express

## Why

While Node.js includes a standard web server implementation via `require('http')`, we still desire an unopinionated, well supported framework, which adds a few key features:

- Routing
- Error handling
- Debugging
- Middleware
- Open source packages
- Support community

## What

[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is the most ubiquitous Node.js web framework, which is managed by the [Node Foundation](https://nodejs.org/en/foundation/). It is used by our [starter kits](starter-kits.md), both for UIs and APIs, as the basis for the applications.

## How

We currently use Express v4.
