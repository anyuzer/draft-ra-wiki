# URI Structure

## Why

TELUS digital does not fully control www.telus.com domain.  www.telus.com currently resolves to an F5 load balancer appliance that is owned by BTO.  We have specific context [paths][f5-www.telus.com] we route to [inbound proxies](../delivery/inbound-proxies/.md) that TELUS digital maintains.

We've been routing various paths in our inbound proxies to our applications deployed on AWS / OpenShift without any guidelines and conventions.

The purpose of this document is to drive consistency for structuring our urls and describe how traffic gets routed to our applications on www.telus.com.

## What

Every HTTP URL conforms to the syntax of a generic URI.

`scheme:[//[user[:password]@]host[:port]][/path][?query][#fragment]`

This document will be concerned with `[/path][?query]` when routing from our TELUS inbound proxies to applications on AWS / OpenShift.

## How

What belongs in `[/path]` portion of URI?

### Routing

Once specific context paths are created in BTO F5 to route to TELUS digital inbound proxies, from there we have control to route to our different applications.

#### www.wcstage.telus.com

We first test such routes on www.wcstage.telus.com and the configurations are maintained in the inbound.telus-gateway-staging-config [repository][telus-gateway-staging-config].

#### www.telus.com

Once we have tested our rotes on www.wcstage.telus.com we can then update configurations for production.  The configurations for production are maintained in the inbound.telus-gateway-production-config [repository][telus-gateway-production-config]

### Selecting Specific Resources

- eg. `my-account/transactions/account/:ban/subscriber/:sub`

What belongs in `[?query]` portion of URI?

- Used once resources have been selected and we want to filter/sort them
