# ESLint

## Why

Across TELUS Digital, we want to have a consistent coding style for our JavaScript, so that our applications feel similar to work on, in order to maximize developer productivity and mobility.

## What

Beyond our basic [code formatting standards](code-formatting.md), we extend the [AirBnB standards](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) to style our code. We use ESLint as a tool to enforce these standards. It gives us fast feedback when there are issues with our code style, and can even fix most of them on its own.

## How

Our [starter kit](starter-kits.md) projects define a standard `.eslintrc` file, with our formatting standards for UIs and APIs.

For the most part, we use AirBnB standards as-is, yet we override some things:

- TODO
- List overrides & rationale...
- `;)`

## Who

Developers, developers, developers, developers.
