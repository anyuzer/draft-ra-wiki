# Automated Performance Testing (Front-End)

## Why

Automated Front-End Performance Testing based on [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) has been added into the pipeline, so that application contributors/owners can keep an eye on how the application performs and block deployments that drop scores under their thresholds.

## What

Configure and run tests automatically in your pipeline 

## How

Automated Performance Testing is part of the [isomorphic starter kit](https://github.com/telusdigital/telus-isomorphic-starter-kit/tree/master/load-test). For more details on setup, see [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).
