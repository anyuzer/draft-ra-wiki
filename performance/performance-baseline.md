# Performance Baseline

## Why

Performance is critical to the success of modern web applications. User engagement has been proven to be highly impacted by initial time to interaction. Additionally in an increasingly mobile world where users may be on slower networks, performance optimization is key to delivering customer value.

With the increasing complexity of our applications though, as well as a multitude of externally impacting factors (ie. analytics, injected global elements, etc), it can be very difficult for teams to know when there are optimization opportunities or when their application has met a sufficient level of performance to be used by customers.

To support teams in their success we require a baseline for performance that teams can measure their projects against to understand what they should be able to achieve using the Reference Architecture.
## What

To diagnose Performance in the Reference Architecture we look in 3 separate places in order to evaluate key problem areas:
- Server.js response time (in ms)
- Chrome Developer tools:
    - Dom Content Loaded
    - Loaded
    - Finished
- Google Page Speed Insights

Each of the above provides a key insight into identifying how to improve your applications performance. Long term performance is measured using New Relic.


## How

#### Baselines
- Server Side Rendering: < 100ms
- DOM Content Loaded < 1s
- Loaded < 2s
- Finished < 2s
- Page Speed Insights: 80+

#### Server Side Rendering Baseline
- < 100ms
- 

#### Chrome Dev Tools Baseline
- Dom Content Loaded
