# API Optimization

## Why

A lot of the time, our applications will need to make API calls when we need data that is sourced by other systems within TELUS.  Every call has a page performance cost, yet we may want to incur the extra time to provide a richer experience to our customers.  We need to always have that in consideration when dealing with API calls.

## What

We now have Load Testing and Performance testing as part of our API Pipelines. This should be relied upon to deliver expected SLAs to consumers. As a consumer, we recommend you log your API response times and build in an automatic warning log that occurs when an API calls exceeds expected SLA.

## How

Some recommendations:  

- Try not to make calls that will block Server Side Render
- Maintain clear visibility on the number of calls that are made by the server and how long they take.
- If your API call is slow, escalate to your friendly API team! (APIs should not be slow)
- Cache reasonably static data on server with safe expiry! (ie. 5 minutes)
- Use internal network routing on the server side.
