# Project Template

## Why

- Developers should be able to easily:
    - Understand a project's purpose and scope
    - Setup / Install dependancies
    - Run unit tests
    - Build / execute a development environment
    - Commit / Contribute back to it
    
## What
This document defines a standard project template for Telus Digital that provides the following benefits:

- Reduced start up time for each project
- Clear expectations of what developers should expect from other projects
- Examples of how to model your own project to be in alignment with best practices across Telus Digital

It covers:
- Readme Template
- Git Hooks
- Commit Standards
    
## How

### GitHub Readme
Every project should have a readme that clearly expresses the following:
- The purpose, scope and goals of the project
- The author / current owners
- Clear up to date instructions on:
    - Setup and installation
    - Running your app (if applicable)
    - Basic usage (API, Endpoints, etc)
    - List of bundled scripts, such as:
        - How to run tests
        - How to run linting
        - etc

The following is a basic example
```markdown
# Project Title

## Why (Purpose)

> e.g. RESTful API to centralize reverse phone number lookup

## What (Technology)

### Requirements

> (node, express.js, psql, etc ...)

### Frameworks/Core 3rd Party Dependencies
> (react, redux, aws-sdk, etc)

### API Docs (if any)

> endpoints, response codes, etc ... 
> this can be broken down into a separate folder `/docs` or links to a swagger file / view

## How (Instructions)

### Installation
> setup and installation instructions

### Tests
> How do you run tests. These should pass after a developer has performed setup/installation properly

### Build/Run
> How do you build (if required) and run. Runtime flags, etc

### Scripts/Tools
> What other scripts are used for development? ie. linting, lint-fix, snyk, etc

## Who

> Outcome team name (link to Confluence Team Page)
> Project leads/maintainers (who somebody should ask if they want to get involved, are going to be making a PR, etc)
```


### Git Hooks 
 Git hooks should not exist as a replacement for good practices, education or mentorship. 
 
 These are the guidelines for git-hooks:
 - **commit-msg: standard** 
    - standardize commit messages
 - **pre-push: standard**
    - run linting and in-process tests before publishing to master branch
 - **all others: non-standard** 
    - unless used to meet special project requirements (talk to your lead)
